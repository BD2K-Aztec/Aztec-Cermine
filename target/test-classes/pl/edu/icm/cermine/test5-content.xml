        <p>Background Recent guidelines on iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) have confirmed the aetiological role of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori), but the relationship still remains controversial. Methods Starting in May 2009, searches of the following databases were undertaken: Medline (1966 to April 2009), Embase (1980 to April 2009), the Cochrane library (1800 to June 2008), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Premedline, Healthstar, CBMdisc and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (January 1970 to April 2009). Changes in haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations and serum ferritin (SF) concentrations were recorded for intervention and control groups. The meta-analysis used random effect models and subgroup analyses were performed to explain heterogeneity. Results Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies were performed in Asia, an area with a high incidence of IDA and H pylori. The pooled analysis of eight studies showed that H pylori eradication therapy can improve IDA, since changes in Hb and SF concentrations in the intervention groups were higher than in controls. The weighted mean difference (WMD) of Hb was 12.88 g/l (95% CI 6.03 to 19.74 g/l, p&lt;0.00001); the WMD of SF was 10.05 mg/l (95% CI 5.48 to 14.63 mg/l, p&lt;0.00001). Conclusions H pylori eradication therapy combined with iron administration is more effective than iron administration alone for the treatment of IDA. Eradication therapy has different effects on adults and children. Bismuth based triple therapy has a better response in terms of increased Hb and SF concentrations than proton pump inhibitor (PPI) based triple therapy.</p>

      <p>Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a global public
health problem affecting both developing and
developed countries, with major consequences for
human health as well as social and economic
development, especially in Asia.1e3 The World Health
Organization estimates the number of people with
IDA worldwide to be a staggering one billion.4Many
risk factors for IDA have been identified, most of
which are related to dietary habits.2 4In the past
decades, the association between Helicobacter pylori
(H pylori) infection and IDA has been controversial.5e7
However, eradication of H pylori has not been clearly
demonstrated to improve IDA. The American College
of Gastroenterology8 suggests adequately powered
research studies are needed to assess whether
H pylori eradication offers benefit to patients with
IDA, especially unexplained IDA.</p>
      <p>We performed a meta-analysis of randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) to determine whether
H pylori eradication treatment is an effective
therapeutic strategy to improve IDA, especially serum
haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations and serum ferritin
(SF) concentrations. (Meta-analysis is the process of
combining several study results that can be used to
draw conclusions about therapeutic effectiveness or
to plan new studies which also avoids the possibility
of prejudice caused by a single study.9)</p>

      <title>Search strategy and identification of studies</title>
      <p>We performed the meta-analysis in accordance
with the standard protocol recommended by the
Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses Group
(QUOROM).10 The following databases were
included in the search: Medline (1966 to April 2009),
Embase (1980 to April 2009), the Cochrane Central
(1800 to June 2008), the Cochrane Library (1800 to
June 2008), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials, Premedline, Healthstar, CBMdisc and the
Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure
Database (January 1970 to April 2009). The search was
limited to RCTs, using the following index terms: ‘H
pylori’, ‘iron deficiency anemia’, ‘sideropenic
refractory anemia’, ‘ferritin’, ‘iron’ and ‘hemoglobin’.
Articles in all languages were included in the search,
and translated as necessary. We sought information
about unpublished and ongoing RCTs from authors
of the included RCTs, and experts in the field. The
Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure
Database was searched in Chinese. The CBMdisc was
searched in Chinese and English. Only reference lists
of selected publications were also individually
searched for any other relevant articles.</p>

    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>Inclusion criteria</title>
      <p>Inclusion criteria were established before
identifying the articles to avoid any selection bias. RCTs
on the relationship between H pylori infection and
IDA, including the data describing the changes of
the blood parameters (Hb and SF concentrations)
between baseline and after treatments, were
considered eligible for meta-analysis. Results of the
studies included in this analysis were described in
terms of baseline and end point blood parameters of
both intervention and control groups, with mean
variables stated as mean6SD. The participants in
the RCTs must have had both H pylori infection
and IDA, without other types of manifest causes of
IDA. The Jadad11 score was utilised to screen out
RCTs of low quality (Jadad score &lt;2).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>Quality assessment</title>
      <p>The quality of the studies was assessed using the scoring system
proposed by Jadad,11 including: selection bias12 (randomisation
procedure and allocation concealment); attrition bias13
(withdrawals, dropouts); and detection bias14 15 (placebo utilisation).
For those studies that did not describe randomisation methods,
we contacted the authors to solicit this information and then
reassessed the scores.</p>

    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>Data extraction</title>
      <p>Two investigators (Huang XL and Qu XH) independently
extracted data by using a structured form. Discrepancies were
resolved by discussion and consultation with two other
reviewers (Yan WL and Huang YL). The following information
was sought from each report: year of publication, sample size,
demographic information including ethnicity, age, and sex,
country and region, method of ascertainment of H pylori,
eradication therapy for H pylori, and changes in mean (SD)
concentrations of Hb and SF in both the intervention and control
groups.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>Data analysis and statistical methods</title>
      <p>We collected the baseline blood parameter values of both the
intervention and control groups, and the reassessment data after
H pylori eradication therapy. Mean changes in blood parameters
between baseline and end point were calculated. The SD of Hb
and SF changes were back-calculated when not provided. We
calculated SD using the formula provided by Follmann et al.16
The correlation coefficient was calculated as 0.13.</p>
      <p>With the intention of comparing mean changes in Hb and SF
between intervention and control groups, we used weighted
mean difference (WMD) and 95% CIs17 to evaluate the
differences between each set of values. Pooled estimates of WMD of
changes in Hb and SF concentrations between the control and
intervention groups were calculated with Review Manager
Version 5,18 and STATA vision 1019 was used to calculate Egger ’s
test in publication bias.</p>

      <title>Heterogeneity assessing</title>
      <p>Meta-analysis should only be considered when a group of trials
is sufficiently homogeneous in terms of participants,
interventions and outcomes to provide a meaningful summary.20 We
examined heterogeneity between trials with a standard Q test
statistic (testing the hypothesis of homogeneity) and present
the I2 value,21 which can be interpreted as the percentage of
total variation across several studies due to heterogeneity.</p>
      <p>For results showing significant heterogeneity (I2 &gt;50%),
a random effects meta-analysis was also performed using the
method of DerSimonian and Laird.22 The underlying

tion of the model is that the studies are from a hypothetical
population and that inter-study variance can be represented by
a single estimate. This estimate allows differential weighting of
studies based on precision. Compared with the fixed effects
model, the random effects model gives greater weight to less
precise studies that may have undesired effects on the summary
estimates.23</p>

    <sec id="sec-9">
      <title>Subgroup analysis</title>
      <p>We utilised subgroup analyses to explore the factors that could
impact the pooled estimates and cause heterogeneity. The
difference of subgroups was tested with t tests. We separated the
studies into groups we assumed to be methodologically or
biologically heterogeneous. Subgroups included: sample size, age,
country and region, degree of IDA, method of ascertainment of
H pylori, eradication therapy for H pylori, and end point of blood
reinspection. According to the classification standard by WHO,
we defined people &lt;18 years old as the children group and
people &gt;18 years old as the adult group. According to the
diagnosis standard for IDA constituted by WHO,33 we defined
those with Hb value of 80e120 g/l as the mild to moderate
anaemia group, and those with a Hb value 60e80 g/l as the
marked (pronounced) anaemia group.</p>

      <p>We identified 1267 potentially eligible articles. After excluding
articles whose titles identified them as irrelevant, we used the
abstracts of the remaining articles to further exclude studies
that were not RCTs (editorials, non-randomised trials,
observational or epidemiological studies, and narrative reviews).
A final total of eight RCTs were identified as eligible for inclusion
in the meta-analysis.25e27 29 31 32 Six RCTs25e32 provided Hb and SF
data, one RCT28 provided only Hb changes, and one RCT30 provided
only SF changes; figure 1 provides a description of these studies.</p>

      <title>Study characteristics</title>
      <p>Our meta-analysis involved 450 participants, ranging in age
from 2e76 years old. Most patients were children from Asia.
Three RCTs26 27 32 involved patients who had mild to moderate
anaemia, and another five RCTs25 28e31 involved patients who
had marked anaemia. Five RCTs26 27 29 31 32 utilised proton
pump inhibitor (PPI) based triple therapy to eradicate H pylori,
and three RCTs25 28 30 used bismuth based triple therapy as their
eradication regimen. The end point for blood parameter
reinspection varied among the studies. Three RCTs26 27 29 selected
8 weeks as the time for reinspection. Three RCTs25 28 30
followed up blood parameters on sequential time nodes. Sarker
et al32 selected 90 days as an end point in his study, and Vijayan
et al31 selected 30 days (1 month) as an end point. Table 1 lists
the characteristics of the eight reviewed studies.</p>

      <title>Summary estimates</title>
      <p>Hb and SF concentrations were selected to evaluate the
therapeutic efficacy of H pylori as effect sizes. Among several
biochemical tests that can reflect the metabolism of iron in the
body, assessment of SF concentrations is the most specific in
correlating with relative total body iron stores, particularly in
the presence of chronic infection. We analysed these two
continuous variables and performed a subgroup analysis for
each. Seven of the eight RCTs provided data on changes in Hb,
showing these changes to be higher in the intervention groups
than in the control groups. The WMD of Hb concentrations
from these seven studies was 12.88 g/l (95% CI 6.03 to 19.74 g/l,
p&lt;0.00001). Figure 2(a) shows the forest plots for the summary
estimates of Hb changes between the intervention and control
groups. The changes of SF in the intervention groups are higher
than in control groups (figure 2(b)). The WMD of SF was

21.15 g/l, p&lt;0.00001), which was lower than the pooled
estimates for adult individuals of 15.11 g/l (95% CI 7.87 to 22.35 g/l,
p¼0.51). The same situation occurred in the pooled analysis of
SF. The WMD of SF for children was 5.93 mg/l (95% CI 4.53 to
7.32 mg/l, p¼0.91), which was lower than the result for adults of
15.08 mg/l (95% CI 11.49 to 18.67 mg/l, p¼0.04) (figure 3).</p>
      <p>The baseline of Hb concentrations was divided into the mild
to moderate anaemia group and the marked anaemia group by
the boundary of 80 g/l. The WMD of the mild to moderate
anaemia group was 9.13 g/l (95% CI 0.40 to 18.66 g/l,
p&lt;0.0001) and the WMD of the marked anaemia group was
16.92 g/l (95% CI 10.37 to 23.46 g/l, p¼0.49). The marked
anaemia group achieved a wider rising range than the mild to
moderate anaemia group.
To examine the therapeutic regimen, we separated the studies
into bismuth and PPI triple therapy. Bismuth triple therapy
showed an obvious advantage over PPI triple therapy,
particularly when used together with oral ferrous sulfate for H pylori
patients with IDA. The WMD of Hb in the bismuth triple
therapy group was 20.73 g/l (95% CI 7.85 to 33.61 g/l, p¼0.02)
versus 10.42 g/l (95% CI 2.75 to 18.08 g/l, p&lt;0.0001) in the PPI
triple therapy group. As for WMD of SF, bismuth triple therapy
also showed obvious advantages over PPI triple therapy:
11.55 mg/l (95% CI 0.09 to 23.01 mg/l, p¼0.0002) versus 9.14 mg/l
(95% CI 3.71 to 14.58 mg/l, p&lt;0.0001) (figure 4).</p>
      <p>The time period for blood parameter reinspection was also
identified as having methodological heterogeneity and we
performed a subanalysis. The WMD of Hb of the 4 week group
was 13.75 g/l (95% CI 8.84 to 18.65 g/l, p¼0.57) compared with
the WMD of the 8 week group of 15.47 g/dl (95% CI 8.98 to
21.97 g/dl, p¼0.03). The WMD of SF of the 4 week group was
2.24 mg/l (95% CI 2.37 to 6.85 mg/l, p¼0.03), compared with
9.99 mg/l (95% CI 5.25 to 14.73 mg/l, p&lt;0.0001) for the 8 week
group. It seemed that the contrast between the intervention
group and the control group increased with time.</p>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
      <p>Sensitivity analysis was performed for both Hb and SF data.
Diversiform means was utilised to test the steadiness of the
results we reached. The results show that most of the
heterogeneity was caused by the study of Sarker et al32 (Q¼23.8) in Hb
changes, and Huang et al26 (Q¼55.32) in SF changes. Hence, we
conducted a sensitivity analysis by excluding these studies and
reassessing the results. The sensitivity analyses showed that the
results we reached were in general robust to the exclusion of the
heterogeneity contributors from the meta-analysis. The WMD
of Hb was 15.58 g/l (95% CI 9.57 to 21.60 g/l, p¼0.04); the
WMD of SF was 11.11 mg/l (95% CI 6.63 to 15.60 mg/l,

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Our meta-analysis, evaluating a total of eight RCTs, shows that
H pylori eradication treatment is an effective therapeutic
strategy to improve IDA, especially Hb and SF concentrations.
The WMD of Hb was 12.88 g/l (95% CI 6.03 to 19.74 g/l,
p&lt;0.00001); the WMD of SF was 10.05 mg/l (95% CI 5.48 to
14.63 mg/l, p&lt;0.00001).</p>
      <p>The association between IDA and H pylori infection and
whether eradication of H pylori could treat IDA has been widely
debated. An earlier review by Muhsen and Cohen34 included
observational studies only. It suggests an association between H
pylori and iron deficiency (pooled OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16 to
1.65) or IDA (pooled OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9 to 4.2). However,
whether eradication of H pylori prevents or treats IDA has not
been determined. In this meta-analysis, we try to answer this
clinical research question.</p>
      <p>In our study, internal validity and external validity were
considered during our study procedure. To avoid selection bias,
we searched not only the Medline database but also Embase, the
Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials, Premedline, Healthstar, and CBMdisc for relevant articles.
To minimise bias in the selection of studies and in data
extraction, reviewers who were blinded to the journal, author,
institution and date of publication, independently selected articles on
the basis of the inclusion criteria. To ensure all the selected
articles were high quality, the studies was assessed using the
scoring system proposed by Jadad et al.11 All of the studies
included had a Jadad score &gt;2.
Eight RCTs, including high quality Chinese trials, satisfied the
inclusion criteria. Almost all RCTs were performed in areas with
a high incidence of H pylori and IDA (China, South Korea, India
and Bangladesh), but all studies were performed in Asia. Thus,
the external validity of our findings may be limited. Also, all the
RCTs only compared the increase in Hb and SF concentrations
achieved with H pylori eradication (plus iron) treatment and
with iron administration alone in patients with IDA.</p>
      <p>Our test for heterogeneity was significant, and hence we
utilised a random effects model that accounts for inter-study
variation. Compared with the fixed effects model, the random
effects model evenly distributes weight among studies,
minimising the impact of heterogeneity.23 So we utilised subgroup
analyses to explore the factors that could affect the pooled
estimates and cause heterogeneity.</p>
      <p>Age was an important determinant of heterogeneity. Because
the prevalence of both H pylori infection and IDA is significantly
age dependent, assessment of the effect of H pylori infection on
the IDA age matched group is meaningful.4 36e38 Iron
requirements on a body weight basis are proportional to growth
velocity. Accordingly, iron requirements of children are larger
than adults and iron deficiency is most common in the preschool
years and during puberty.4 During the preschool years and
puberty, because of the large demand and poor dietary pattern,
a given diet may be low in iron or may contain adequate
amounts of iron which are of low bioavailability. Other
nutrients necessary for haematopoiesis may also be deficient.39
In addition, vulnerability to iron deficiency varies greatly with
each stage of life. In general, children aged 6 months to 5 years
are the most vulnerable.40 To test this hypothesis, we separated
individuals into an adult group and a children group.
The result indicated that the adult group achieved a better
response from the eradication of H pylori than the children
group.</p>
      <p>Heterogeneity can be also caused by a variety of eradication
methods. The way in which the RCTs chose to eradicate H pylori
can make a difference in pooled analysis. Bismuth based triple
therapy achieved a much better response in regard to iron intake
than PPI based triple therapy, probably by inhibiting intragastric
proteolysis.35</p>
      <p>All the RCTs took 2 weeks to eradicate H pylori, but the time
for iron supplementation varied from study to study. Four weeks
and 8 weeks were considered as time points to test the response
to the intervention, so we divided the studies into 4 weeks and
8 weeks and undertook a subanalysis. It turned out that the
8 week iron supplement group had a much better response than</p>

the 4 week group. We suggest that further studies should be
undertaken to evaluate the long term effect of H pylori
eradication on correcting IDA.</p>
      <p>Other patient characteristics (extent of H pylori infection and
sex distribution) are also important for diagnostic accuracy, but
variation in data presentation and incomplete reporting of the
data made it impossible to study the effect of these variables. In
this meta-analysis, we also attempted to reveal the relationship
between the country of origin and the diagnostic accuracy, the
result showing no significant statistical difference.</p>
      <p>Our meta-analysis has several limitations. Only eight RCTs
were available, and all the studies were performed in Asia.
Eradication treatment without ferrous sulfate can illustrate
the character H pylori plays in the IDA in a better way, but
there is only few studies relevant, so we excluded these studies.
This concept should be discussed in the future. We expect
further investigations will take study design into consideration.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, on the basis of the best available evidence, our
meta-analysis suggests that H pylori eradication can improve
IDA. These findings support the guidelines of the American
College of Gastroenterology.8 Refractory IDA patients should be
considered for assessment and treatment of H pylori. A strategy
of population based screening and treatment for H pylori
infection to prevent IDA is not currently recommended, but this
concept should be discussed in the future. Eradication therapy
has different effect on adults and adolescents. Bismuth based
triple therapy has a better response in terms of increased Hb and
SF concentrations than proton pump inhibitor (PPI) based triple
therapy.</p>
