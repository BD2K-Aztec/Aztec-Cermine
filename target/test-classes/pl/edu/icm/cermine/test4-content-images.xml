        <p>Background: Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) is an alternative splicing factor containing four CCCH Zinc fingers (ZnFs). The sequestration of MBNL1 by expanded CUG and CCUG repeats is a major component in causing myotonic dystrophy. In addition to binding the structured expanded CUG and CCUG repeats; previous results suggested that MBNL1 binds single-stranded RNAs containing GC dinucleotides. Results: We performed a systematic analysis of MBNL1 binding to single-stranded RNAs. These studies revealed that a single GC dinucleotide in poly-uridine is sufficient for MBNL1 binding and that a second GC dinucleotide confers higher affinity MBNL1 binding. However additional GC dinucleotides do not enhance RNA binding. We also showed that the RNA sequences adjacent to the GC dinucleotides play an important role in MBNL1 binding with the following preference: uridines &gt;cytidines &gt;adenosines &gt;guanosines. For high affinity binding by MBNL1, the distance between the two GC dinucleotides can vary from 1 to 17 nucleotides. Conclusions: These results suggest that MBNL1 is highly flexible and able to adopt different conformations to recognize RNAs with varying sequence configurations. Although MBNL1 contains four ZnFs, only two ZnF - GC dinucleotide interactions are necessary for high affinity binding.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>
        Alternative pre-mRNA splicing significantly increases
genome diversity with recent measurements suggesting that
greater than 90% of genes undergo alternative splicing
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref2 ref3">1-3</xref>
        ]. The different protein isoforms generated through
alternative splicing can alter function or cellular
localization, or it may provide a mechanism to regulate the levels
of the protein by leading to non-productive splicing and
RNA turnover (reviewed in [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref5">4,5</xref>
        ]). Regulated alternative
splicing is dependent upon the alternative splicing factors
present in specific cell types or at different developmental
stages. Many of these alternative splicing factors appear to
regulate hundreds of exons and they function by
recognizing specific RNA sequence elements within or near the
regulated exons (reviewed in [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ]).
      </p>
      <p>
        Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) is an alternative splicing
factor that is associated with the disease myotonic
dystrophy (DM). Patients with DM have a CTG or
CCTG repeat expansion in an untranslated region of
their genome. For DM type 1 (DM1), the CTG repeats
are found in the 3’ UTR of the DMPK gene, and for
DM type 2 (DM2), the CCTG repeats are found within
intron 1 of the CCHC-type zinc finger (ZnF), nucleic
acid binding protein (CNBP) gene [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7 ref8">7,8</xref>
        ]. These CTG and
CCTG repeats, when transcribed, form CUG/CCUG
RNA stem loops that bind and sequester MBNL1 into
nuclear foci resulting in a loss of normal MBNL1
function in the cell (reviewed in [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ]). In studying the
molecular basis of DM and the role MBNL1 plays, it was
discovered that MBNL1 regulates the alternative splicing
of a host of developmentally regulated transcripts
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref11 ref12 ref13">10-13</xref>
        ]. In the cells of DM patients, adult splicing
patterns revert back to embryonic splicing patterns and
these incorrect splicing events are thought to cause
many of the symptoms of the disease (reviewed in [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ]).
      </p>
      <p>
        Several MBNL1 binding sites have been identified, and
a few of these have been characterized [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref14 ref15 ref16 ref17">10,14-17</xref>
        ].
Complicating the analysis of MBNL1 binding to these sites
and the CUG and CCUG repeats has been
differentiating between the effects of RNA structure on MBNL1
binding and sequence specific RNA binding. MBNL1
interacts with RNA through its four CCCH ZnFs,
although it is possible that other regions of the protein
interact with RNA as well or play an important role in
regulating splicing [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
        ]. The ZnFs of MBNL1 fold into
two compact domains ZnFs1/2 and ZnFs3/4 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref20">19,20</xref>
        ]. A
crystal structure of ZnFs3/4 in complex with a 6 mer
RNA (CGCUGU) revealed that these ZnFs bind
singlestranded RNA through specific recognition of the
Watson-Crick face of the GC dinucleotide [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ]. Each ZnF (3
and 4) interacts with RNA in a similar manner and the
structure of the ZnFs domain in complex with RNA
lead Teplova and Patel to propose that MBNL1 binds
RNA in a looped conformation [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ]. This model
predicts that for each ZnF to bind a GC dinucleotide a
significant RNA linker must separate the GC dinucleotides
because the RNA binding surfaces of ZnFs3/4 (or 1/2)
are on opposing sides of the domain [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ]. Binding to
RNAs containing three different RNA linkers of 5, 10
and 15 nucleotides between the GC dinucleotides to
ZnFs3/4 of MBNL1 supported this model [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ]. However
these experiments were only performed with the isolated
ZnFs3/4 and it was unclear if the spacer would be
important in the context of the four ZnFs of MBNL1.
To determine if the spacing between GC dinucleotides
was important for MBNL1 binding and to determine if
the sequence of the RNA linker between the GC
dinucleotides affected RNA binding, a series of
singlestranded RNAs varying linker distances and different
linker sequences were studied with MBNL1.

      <title>Results and discussion</title>
      <p>
        To better understand the RNA binding specificity of
human MBNL1, we used a version of the protein that
contains amino acids 2-260. Previous studies have
shown that MBNL1 2-260, which contains all four ZnFs,
binds RNA as well as the corresponding full-length
protein [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        ]. This version of the protein was used due to its
ease in expression and purification in a bacterial system.
This region of the protein has been shown to be
sufficient for splicing regulation [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
        ].

        <title>Determination of the number of GC dinucleotides required for high affinity binding by MBNL1</title>
        <p>
          According to the crystal structure of the MBNL1 ZnFs3/
4 - RNA complex [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
          ], the primary determinant of RNA
specificity is the recognition of the Watson-Crick faces
of the GC dinucleotide by the ZnFs. To test the
importance of the GC dinucleotide in the context of
singlestranded RNA for binding to MBNL1, one to four of
these motifs were placed into a poly-uridine RNA
(Figure 1A). Uridines were chosen as the template because
we had previously shown that MBNL1 generally prefers
uridines compared to the other three nucleotides [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
          ].
Additionally, poly-uridine lacks RNA structure so the
role of RNA structure in binding can be minimized
allowing the focus to be on the role of specificity in a
single-stranded RNA substrate.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine if these RNAs are single-stranded, a
thermal denaturation assay was used to monitor the
structure of these RNAs. For all RNAs tested with one
to four GC dinucleotides, the melting point was below
40°C (Figure 1G), while the (CUG)4 RNA which was
previously shown to be structured and bind MBNL1
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
          ] has a melting point of 60.6 +/- 0.6°C (Figure 1G).
These thermal denaturation results indicate that these
model RNAs are primarily single-stranded and can be
used to test MBNL1’s specificity in the absence of RNA
structure. A possibility we cannot discount is that when
MBNL1 binds RNA it could stabilize weak RNA
structures; therefore we cannot completely rule out the role
of RNA structure. Further experiments would be needed
to explore this possibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          As expected, when both GC dinucleotides are mutated
to any other sequence or their polarity is reversed (2CC,
2GG and 2CG), MBNL1 binding is eliminated at the
concentrations of protein tested (Figure 1B). Although
we had found previously that MBNL1 prefers uridines
over the other three nucleotides [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
          ], these results
showed that MBNL1 does not bind to long stretches of
uridines alone with appreciable affinity.
        </p>
        <p>Surprisingly, the presence of a single GC dinucleotide
was sufficient for high affinity binding by MBNL1 (Figure
1C). The 1GC RNA bound with a Kd of 45 nM while the
2GC RNA bound with a Kd of 11 nM. These results
indicate that MBNL1 requires only one GC dinucleotide for
one of its four ZnFs to achieve significant RNA binding.
Although the 1GC RNA bound with relatively high
affinity, the complex appeared to dissociate during the gel
shift assay based on the observed smearing (Figure 1C).
To confirm the gel shift assay results, a competition assay
was used. In this assay, MBNL1 was pre-bound to a
radioactive 2GC RNA to form a stable complex. Then
increasing amounts of cold competitive RNA were added
(Figure 1D). The competition results showed a larger
difference between the 1GC and 2GC RNAs compared to
the binding assays (15-fold in the competition assay
versus 4-fold in the gel shift assay); however these results
are consistent with the gel shift assay and further
demonstrate that MBNL1 only requires one GC dinucleotide for
nanomolar affinity binding by MBNL1 to RNA. The
differences in relative affinities between the 2GC and 1GC
RNAs in the gel shift and competition assays may be due
to the instability of the 1GC-MBNL complex making
quantification of this complex in the gel shift assay
difficult to measure accurately.</p>
        <p>To determine if more than two GC dinucleotides
increased RNA binding by MBNL1, a longer RNA (29
nucleotides, Figure 1E) containing up to four GC
dinucleotides was used for binding studies. The
oligonucleotides with two, three, or four dinucleotides all behaved
in a similar manner (Figure 1F). MBNL1 formed a
single complex with all RNAs and the Kds were all within
error of each other (2.5 to 4.0 nM). A RNA containing
one GC dinucleotide (1GC#2) was also tested in the
context of the longer RNA and it showed an
approximately 5-fold increase in Kd with lower complex
stability (smearing) as seen with the shorter 1GC RNA
(Figure 1, compare 1GC and 1GC#2). These results
indicate that adding more than two GC dinucleotides
did not enhance MBNL1 binding to RNA in this
context.</p>
        <p>
          The observation that RNAs containing three or four
GC dinucleotides didn’t bind MBNL1 better than RNAs
containing just two GC dinucleotides was surprising. It
suggests that only two of the four ZnFs require GC
motifs for high affinity binding while the other two
ZnFs may bind other sequences such as a poly-uridine
or are involved in an intramolecular interaction that
precludes RNA binding. This intramolecular interaction
is supported by the MBNL1 ZnFs3/4 crystal structure
which formed a ZnF4 - ZnF4 interaction with a 1320 Å2
interface that would preclude ZnF4 from binding RNA
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
          ]. Thus we might predict that ZnF2 and ZnF4 are
involved in a higher order structure while ZnF1 and
ZnF3 are involved in RNA binding. Although it is
possible that the two ZnFs involved in RNA binding could be
any of the four ZnFs, as none of the ZnFs alone have
been directly tested for RNA binding. In comparing this
model with the known endogenous MBNL1 targets, it
can be seen that many of these binding sites contain
only two YGCY motifs suggesting that a mode in which
MBNL1 uses only two of its ZnFs to bind YGCY motifs
could be a common type of interaction for MBNL1
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref14 ref15 ref16">10,14-16</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          An alternative explanation for the lack of increased
MBNL1 binding to more than two GC motifs is that the
RNA we used may not allow all four GC dinucleotides
to bind all four ZnFs. However, in RNA 3GC#3 the
three GC dinucleotides are spaced by nine and twelve
nucleotides, and the model proposed by Teplova and
Patel describing MBNL1 binding to RNAs with multiple
GC dinucleotides suggests that this type of spacing
would allow for binding by three of the four ZnFs [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
          ].
Our data described later also suggests that an RNA
containing two GC dinucleotides with only a single
nucleotide spacing does not result in a dramatic decrease in
binding. This supports the idea that the spacing of the
GC dinucleotides was not a problem in these RNA
constructs.

      <sec id="sec-2-2">
        <title>The role of nucleotides adjacent to the GC dinucleotides in MBNL1 RNA binding</title>
        <p>
          Our previous research showed enrichment for YGCY in
a SELEX assay of MBNL1 2-260, however the
importance of the pyrimidines upstream and downstream of
the GC was never directly tested [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
          ]. Therefore we set
about to determine the importance of nucleotides
upstream and downstream of the GC dinucleotide by
making mutations to these nucleotides in the context of
the 2GC RNA (Figure 2A). The CGCC RNA bound as
well as the 2GC RNA, with Kds of 7 nM and 11 nM
respectively (Figure 2B). Replacing all of the uridines
with cytidines decreased binding by 10-fold (Figure 2C,
RNA C with a Kd of 111 nM). However if the upstream
and downstream cytidines were replaced with uridines
(RNA C4, Figure 2C), wild type levels of RNA binding
were restored. These results suggest that MBNL1
requires some uridines to be near the GC dinucleotides
but that there is some flexibility in their location relative
to the GC motifs.

GC motifs significantly reduced MBNL1 binding. The

presence of adenosines adjacent to the GC dinucleotide
weakened binding to MBNL1 by 5-fold while guanosines
in these positions reduced binding by 40-fold (Figure
2B, RNAs AGCA and GGCG). Placing two UGCU
motifs into a polyA RNA resulted in more than a
10fold reduction in binding compared to the 2GC RNA
(Figure 2C, A4 RNA), indicating that positions outside
of the UGCU motifs also affect MBNL1’s ability to bind
RNA.</p>
        <p>
          Our characterization of MBNL1 binding specificity is
consistent with our previously proposed MBNL1
binding site motif of YGCY [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
          ]. However, there seems to
be an additional requirement of a uridine rich context
as seen by the 10-fold decrease in binding between a
cytidine rich and a uridine rich environment. This
YGCY and U-rich requirement is not explained by the
crystal structure of ZnFs3/4 in complex with RNA. In
this structure ZnF3 only interacts with the GC
dinucleotide and ZnF4 makes one base specific contact with the
downstream uridine, therefore recognizing a GCU motif
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
          ]. One explanation for this apparent discrepancy
between our results and the crystal structure is that
important protein-RNA contacts were not captured in
the crystal structure. It is possible that ZnFs1/2 makes
different RNA contacts than ZnFs3/4 or amino acids
outside of the crystallized domains interact with RNA.
Further studies are required to determine which regions
of the protein are responsible for these additional RNA
sequence requirements.

        <title>MBNL1 RNA binding</title>
        <p>
          The crystal structures of the individual ZnFs domains of
MBNL1 suggested that a RNA linker of 20 Å would be
required to allow two ZnFs in one domain to each bind
a GC dinucleotide [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
          ]. In support of this model,
Teplova and Patel showed that decreasing the GC
dinucleotide linker from 15 or 10 nucleotides to 5
nucleotides reduced RNA binding with the ZnFs3/4 domain
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
          ]. To determine if the distance between the two GC
dinucleotides affects the binding of MBNL1 containing
four ZnFs we systematically varied the distance between
the GC motifs in the 2GC RNA (Figure 3A).
Interestingly, the RNAs that bound MBNL1 with the highest
affinity (Kds of 4-6 nM) had the longest and shortest
linkers (Figure 3B). The RNAs with intermediate length
RNA linkers of seven to 11 nucleotides bound MBNL1
with Kds between 20 and 30 nM. MBNL1’s ability to
bind all of these RNAs with relatively high affinity
suggests that the two ZnFs domains can adopt different
orientations to recognize the GC dinucleotides. The
weaker binding to the RNAs containing intermediate
length RNA linkers could be due to MBNL1 needing to
adopt a slightly less favorable conformation to bind the
        </p>
        <p>RNA compared to the conformation adopted when
binding short or long linker RNAs.</p>
        <p>In MBNL1, the ZnFs domains are separated by 114
amino acids and we propose that this region of the
protein provides flexibility that allows the ZnFs domains to
bind RNAs with a wide range of spacing between the
primary GC motifs. Figure 4 shows a model in which
the ZnFs domains are oriented such that ZnF1 and
ZnF3 are binding an RNA with a single nucleotide
spacer between the GC dinucleotides. Although ZnFs3/4
was crystallized with a single GC RNA, there are
multiple RNAs bound to this domain in the crystal structure.
This structure allowed us to model how MBNL1 might
bind an RNA containing two GC dinucleotides,
assuming that the two RNAs observed in the crystal structure
would normally be found in one longer RNA. The
orientation of the ZnFs domains shown in Figure 4 may
favor ZnFs domain-domain interactions that could
contribute to the high affinity RNA binding seen with
the 1 and 3 nucleotide spacer RNAs (Figure 3A). Other
orientations of the ZnFs domains are possible such that
ZnF2 and ZnF4 bind the RNA for example. The
flexibility of MBNL1 may explain why it is able to recognize a
diverse set of RNA targets that include the toxic CUG/
CCUG repeats and many different sites within
premRNAs.</p>
        <p>The proposed model explains how MBNL1 may
recognize a wide range of single-stranded RNA targets,
but it does not address how MBNL1 interacts with
structured RNAs such as the CUG/CCUG repeats or
stem-loop targets found in its pre-mRNA targets. It is
possible that MBNL1 binds the YGCY motifs in the
structured RNAs when these nucleotides are accessible
(GC dinucleotides flipped out so the Watson-Crick face
of the GC dinucleotides can be bound by the ZnFs
domains) in these RNA targets. The flexibility of the
linker between the ZnFs domains would allow MNBL1 to
easily reach two sites on different parts of a structured
RNA. Alternatively, MBNL1 may recognize its
structured RNA targets using a different mode of
recognition. In the future biochemical approaches using
techniques in addition to the gel shift assay and
structural studies will be necessary to determine if MBNL1
use one or more modes of binding to recognize
singlestranded and structured RNA substrates.</p>

          ] except that for our studies
the protein was stored at -80°C rather than at -20°C.

        <title>RNA synthesis, labeling, and purification</title>
        <p>All RNAs were synthesized by Integrated DNA
Technologies and 5’ end labeled with [g-32P]ATP. RNAs were
then purified on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel
(19:1) and eluted into TE Buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM
EDTA). RNA was then ethanol precipitated with
glycogen and resuspended in TE Buffer. Finally a Bio-spin 6
column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in TE Buffer was used.</p>

        <title>RNA thermal denaturation assay</title>
        <p>1.5 μM RNA was incubated at 95°C for two minutes in
100 mM NaCl, 21 mM Tris 7.5, and 5 mM MgCl2.
RNA was then incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The
thermal denaturation analysis was performed on a Carey
UV/VIS Spectrophotometer. The absorbance of the
RNA was monitored at 260 nm while the temperature
was increased from 15-90°C. Melting temperatures were
determined by calculating the derivative of the
absorbance versus temperature using the Cary program
“Thermal”. All RNAs were tested three times and Tm
values compared. The Tm of all the RNAs used in these
studies were measured at below 40°C while the (CUG)4
RNA was measured with a Tm of 60.6 +/- 0.6°C.</p>

        <title>Gel mobility shift assay</title>
        <p>RNA was initially heated to 95 °C for two minutes and
then placed directly onto ice. RNA was then mixed with
MBNL1 at concentrations indicated in the figures. The
final reaction conditions were 100 mM NaCl, 21 mM
Tris pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mg/mL BSA, 0.1 mg/mL
Heparin, 0.5 mM BME, 5 mM DTT, 0.02% Triton
X100, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol
blue, and 0.02 nM RNA. The samples were incubated at
room temperature for 30 minutes and then loaded onto
a pre-chilled 6% polyacrylamide (19:1) gel running at 50
volts. Once the samples were loaded the voltage was
increased to 150 volts and the gel was run for 30
minutes. After running, the gel was dried and exposed
overnight.</p>

          Quantitation of the binding curve was described
previously [

        <p>Competition assays were run under the same conditions
as the gel shift assays except that the protein and
radioactive RNA were incubated for 20 minutes and then the
competitive RNA was added to the reaction and allowed
to equilibrate for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>Quantitation of the competition assays was done using

        <title>Modeling of MBNL1 binding RNA</title>
        <p>PDB files 3D2N and 3D2S were used to create Figure 4.
Each PDB file was opened in separate Pymol windows.
3d2S contained ZnFs3/4 bound to RNA. The structure
originally contained a ZnFs3/4 dimer bound to RNA.
The extra ZnFs3/4 was removed and the RNA bound to
ZnF4 was removed for the figure. In the other window
the ZnFs1/2 structure (3D2N) was oriented to place the
hypothesized cytidine binding pocket towards the
unbound cytidine from 3D2S. Figures were then made
of each of these windows and were merged in
Photoshop. The amino acid linker was then added by linking
the C-terminal amino acid from ZnFs1/2 with the
Nterminal amino acid from ZnFs3/4.</p>
